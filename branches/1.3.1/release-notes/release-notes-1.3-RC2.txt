BTM - Bitronix's JTA transaction manager
========================================
version 1.3-RC2, July 30, 2008

 * BTM-4   Implement incremental recovery
 * BTM-7   Resource password is not decrypted when using the API
 * BTM-8   Durable subscribers cannot participate in XA
 * BTM-9   BitronixTransactionManager JNDI reference throws NPE on toString()
 * BTM-10  Race condition in connection pools when lazily initialized
 * BTM-11  Implement an embedded JNDI provider that allows to retrieve the TM and configured resources in a more standard way
 * BTM-12  add maven support
 * BTM-13  Implement ordering of XAResource during 2PC execution
 * BTM-14  Need the ability to have BTM invoke specific methods on JDBC connection upon return to the pool
 * BTM-17  Set tx status to marked_rollback on timeout
 * BTM-18  Invoke XAResource.setTransactionTimeout() when a resource is enlisted
 * BTM-19  No effect by setting auto-commit to false on LrcConnectionHandle
 * BTM-20  XAResourceManager incorrectly checking resource joinability
 * BTM-21  Differing journal-file lengths cause BTM to fail to start even if skipCorrectedLogs is true
 * BTM-22  Resource rollback not handled properly
 * Dropped all deprecated classes and methods.
 * Shutdown hook is not registered anymore when the TM starts up. It is now mandatory to shut it down manually.
 * Fixed incorrect transaction manager startup while using pools when BTM is not started.
 * Moved CryptoEngine to bitronix.tm.utils, kept bitronix.tm.internal.CryptoEngine but deprecated it.
 * Resource Loader cannot bind to JNDI anymore (no more needed, see: BTM-11), this obsoletes bitronix.tm.resource.bind property.
 * Transaction timeout logic has been rationalized, this obsoletes bitronix.tm.timer.transactionRetryInterval property.
 * Lowered statement cache overhead when it is disabled.
 * Fixed bug in the double LRC enlistment check that prevented safe cases from working.
 * Upgraded JTA and JMS jars to the latest 1.4-compiled version.
 * Added new configuration property 'journal' that allows to switch between the classic 'disk' journal and a new non-logging 'null' journal.
 * Fixed lots of misc bugs. 

Important note
--------------
 Incremental recovery required a change in the Disk Journal's log format. Compatibility with older format (1.2 and below)
 has been maintained but journals created by BTM 1.3 cannot be used by older versions.
