BTM - Bitronix's JTA transaction manager
========================================
version 1.0, August 4, 2007

 * Moved to Codehaus.
 * Pending JMS sessions are now closed when a JMS connection goes back into the pool.
 * GUI: implemented filtering by GTRID.
 * Made pooling objects directly instanciatable. No need to create another object on
   which createResource() has to be called.
 * Allowed restarting the TM after it has shutdown.
